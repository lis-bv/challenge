# LIS Challenge

Welcome to the LIS Challenge.

During the interview we will walk through the code in this repo together. The application is not yet functioning completely and during the interview we will try to get it working again, or at least discuss about how it can work again and of course also how the code can be improved.

## Topics

Some of the topics that will be handled are:

- Routing
- Data binding
- Events
- Modules/Services/Components
- Observables (RxJS)
- Dependency Injection
